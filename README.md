Road-Guardian is a Road-Guardian is a mobile application prototype designed to improve road safety for users such as drivers and riders. The app monitors for potential emergency situations on the road, such as accidents or sudden hazards, and can send timely alerts to pre-selected emergency contacts.

Key aspects of the project include:

Emergency Alerts: Automatically notifies designated contacts when the user may be in danger.

Location Awareness: Uses device location to help contacts identify the user’s position in case of an emergency.

User Privacy & Safety: The app prioritizes user consent and ensures notifications are only sent to trusted contacts.

Educational Prototype: Designed as a college-level project to demonstrate mobile safety technology concepts and alert systems.

The app emphasizes responsible usage, testing with simulated scenarios, and following privacy guidelines, making it a safe and educational project for learning mobile development and road safety solutions.

Features ✅

Feature 1 — e.g., Real-time traffic monitoring

Feature 2 — e.g., Alerts for road hazards

Feature 3 — e.g., Data visualization of road incidents

Feature 4 — e.g., User-friendly interface for navigation.

Purpose 🎯

The primary goal of Road-Guardian is to raise awareness about how technology can be used to enhance road safety. It serves as a demonstration of how emergency alerts and location sharing can assist during accidents or dangerous situations, while emphasizing ethical and responsible development practices.
